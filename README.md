As a part of my first Fall Semester at University of Michigan, I am taking this course named 'Data Science and Analytics Using Python' to meet the requirements of my program, which is Masters in Data Science. The purpose of this course is to teach about data science tools, concepts and framework which are prevalent in the industry, through the use of Python. After an accelerated introduction to programming with Python, the course will dig deep into numerical computing tools, handling structured data through exploration and visualization, and introduce deep learning concepts and frameworks. The purpose of this repository is to maintain version control and log the homeworks, assignments, required notes, practice notebooks and work on the final project.
